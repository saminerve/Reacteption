# Currency for iOS

![View of the Currency app for iOS running on an iPhone](https://i.imgur.com/1dOwsfP.jpg)

This project is a simple currency converter app for iOS, built by a designer while learning iOS development in Swift. It is available on the App Store for free to download [here](https://itunes.apple.com/app/currency-simple-currency-calculator/id1109685198?mt=8).

## Motivation

This project is a learning exercise in Swift programming. I seek primarily to get feedback and critique on the code written for this project, but feedback on the overall design and idea is also welcome.

## Swift

This project is written in Swift 4.

## Installation

This project uses [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org). Below is the setup to configure Cocoa Pods in your machine.

To install Cocoa Pods, run:
```
$ sudo gem install cocoapods
```

To install the required pods for this project, change to the project directory and run:
```
$ pod install
```

## API Reference

This project makes use of the [Yahoo Query Language (YQL) API](https://developer.yahoo.com/yql/) to get currency exchange rates. You can test query statements on the [YQL Console](https://developer.yahoo.com/yql/console/).

An example YQL statement to fetch the USD to JPY exchange rate looks like:
```
select * from yahoo.finance.xchange where pair in ("USDJPY")
```

And the resulting XML REST query looks like:
```
https://query.yahooapis.com/v1/public/yql?q=select%20*%20from%20yahoo.finance.xchange%20where%20pair%20in%20(%22USDJPY%22)&diagnostics=true&env=store%3A%2F%2Fdatatables.org%2Falltableswithkeys
```

## Initial Data

For this project an initial database is created with the currency data from this [Google Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1218JsxdKNp3ytpAtIq8D1Wtl9t4blLpC2amTweWDhek/edit?usp=sharing). Please add a comment if some of the data is incorrect. Exchange rates are updated using the Yahoo API above while the app is being used as rates fluctuate daily.

## Tests

There are no tests written for this application so far.
